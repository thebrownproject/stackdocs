## AI-Powered Automated Distribution

The goal: Build systems that get Stackdocs in front of users **without manual outreach**. Three pillars:

1. **LLM SEO** - Get cited by AI assistants (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity)
2. **Programmatic SEO** - Auto-generate thousands of targeted pages
3. **Automated Directory Presence** - Bulk submission + passive discovery

---

### Pillar 1: LLM SEO (Answer Engine Optimization)

**What it is:** Optimizing content so AI assistants cite Stackdocs when users ask "what's the best tool for invoice extraction?" or similar queries.

**Why it matters:**
- AI search referrals convert **4.4x better** than traditional search
- AI referrals grew **1,300%** for retail in 2024 holidays
- This is where discovery is moving - get ahead now

#### Key Tactics

| Tactic | Implementation | Priority |
|--------|----------------|----------|
| **Structured Content** | Headings, bullet points, tables, lists (pages cited by ChatGPT average 14 list sections) | High |
| **Schema Markup** | FAQ, HowTo, Organization, Article schema on all pages | High |
| **Q&A Format** | Structure content as direct questions and answers | High |
| **Entity Optimization** | Consistent brand mentions across credible sources | Medium |
| **E-E-A-T Signals** | Author bios, factual accuracy, regular updates | Medium |
| **Technical SEO** | Server-side rendering, minimal JS, fast loading | Medium |

#### Content Structure for AI Citation

```markdown
## What is Stackdocs?
Stackdocs is a document data extraction SaaS that uses AI to...

## How does Stackdocs extract data from invoices?
Stackdocs uses [specific process]...

## What makes Stackdocs different from [competitor]?
Unlike [competitor], Stackdocs offers Stacks - multi-document extraction...
```

#### Measurement
- Track brand mentions in ChatGPT/Perplexity/Claude responses
- Monitor AI referral traffic in analytics
- Check "index coverage" by LLM crawlers

---

### Pillar 2: Programmatic SEO

**What it is:** Auto-generating thousands of pages targeting long-tail keywords, each uniquely optimized without manual writing.

**Why it matters:**
- Case study: SaaS scaled from 67 to **2,100 monthly signups** in 10 months
- One company launched **15,000 pages in 90 days**
- Captures searches competitors ignore

#### Implementation Approach

**Step 1: Build Keyword Matrix**

Create structured data with variables:

| Variable | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Document Type | invoice, receipt, contract, quote, purchase order |
| Industry | construction, retail, healthcare, legal, real estate |
| Action | extract, process, automate, digitize, convert |
| Format | PDF, image, scan, photo |
| Modifier | free, AI, best, online, automated |

**Generates keywords like:**
- "AI invoice extraction for construction"
- "automate PDF receipt processing healthcare"
- "best free contract data extraction"
- "online quote digitization tool"

**Step 2: Template System**

Create page templates that auto-populate:

```
/solutions/[industry]/[document-type]/

Example: /solutions/construction/invoice-extraction/
- Dynamic H1: "AI Invoice Extraction for Construction"
- Industry-specific pain points (auto-populated)
- Relevant schema (auto-generated)
- Internal links to related pages
```

**Step 3: Execution**

| Phase | Action | Timeline |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Build | Create keyword matrix in spreadsheet | Week 1 |
| Template | Design 3-5 page templates | Week 2 |
| Generate | Batch create 100-200 pages | Week 3 |
| QA | Review in staging, fix issues | Week 4 |
| Deploy | Launch in weekly sprints of 50-100 | Ongoing |
| Optimize | Monitor rankings, iterate on templates | Ongoing |

**Tools:**
- **Content generation:** Jasper, Claude API, or custom scripts
- **SEO validation:** SEMrush for search volumes
- **Automation:** WP All Import or Next.js dynamic routes

#### Example Page Categories

1. **Industry verticals:** `/solutions/[industry]/`
   - construction, healthcare, legal, real estate, retail

2. **Document types:** `/extract/[document-type]/`
   - invoices, receipts, contracts, quotes, purchase orders

3. **Comparisons:** `/compare/stackdocs-vs-[competitor]/`
   - Auto-generate competitor comparison pages

4. **Use cases:** `/use-cases/[specific-scenario]/`
   - "extract line items from contractor invoices"
   - "batch process expense receipts"

---

### Pillar 3: Automated Directory Presence

**What it is:** Systematic submission to directories where users discover tools, creating passive inbound traffic.

#### AI/SaaS Directories (Priority Order)

| Directory | Why | Free? | Action |
|-----------|-----|-------|--------|
| **There's An AI For That** | Huge traffic, AI-focused audience | Yes | Submit first |
| **SaaSHub** | Users searching for alternatives | Yes | High intent traffic |
| **AlternativeTo** | Massive directory, unbiased reviews | Yes | Captures switchers |
| **Futurepedia** | Curated AI tools | Yes | Quality audience |

| **Indie Hackers** | Founder network, ongoing exposure | Yes | Community feedback |
| **StackShare** | Developer/CTO audience | Yes | Tech decision makers |
| **G2/Capterra** | Enterprise credibility | Yes | Review-driven |

#### Automation Approach

1. **Create master submission doc:**
   - Product name, tagline, description (short/long)
   - Screenshots, demo video URL
   - Pricing, category tags
   - Founder info

2. **Batch submit weekly:**
   - Submit to 5-10 directories per week
   - Track in spreadsheet (submitted, approved, live)
   - Some directories feature automatically; others queue

3. **Set and forget:**
   - Once listed, directories drive passive traffic
   - Users find Stackdocs when searching for alternatives
   - SEO backlinks compound over time

**Key insight:** Each pillar reinforces the others. More pages = more chances for AI to cite you. More directory presence = stronger brand signals for LLMs. The system compounds.
